# Frontend Mentor Challenge Repository

This repository contains my solutions for the challenges from [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/), including [components](<https://github.com/inurhuda00/didactic-engine/tree/main/src/routes/(challenges)>) building and design slicing exercises.

## Built With

The website was built using:

-   [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/)
-   [SvelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev/)
-   [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)
-   [UnoCSS](https://unocss.com/)

### Svelte and SvelteKit

The main reason for using Svelte and SvelteKit is the ability to apply scoped styles. This allows for styles, including fonts, to be changed on a per-page basis.

### Tailwind CSS and UnoCSS

Tailwind CSS is great for consistency in styling and is also familiar to me. Additionally, Tailwind CSS IntelliSense in VS Code extensions is excellent. UnoCSS, on the other hand, has instant on-demand styling which is very powerful.
